Auction Outline: 

Participants: 
- to participate in an auction you can either be a permanent user or a guest user 
- to be a permanent user you need to sign up and create an account on the auction website. If you choose to be a permanent user you automatically joining fee of X amont of Wolvereine Coin. 
- guest users can just continue as guest and can set up a guest profile to continue to participate in the auction


How to Sell Things: 
- you must be logged in as a guest or permanent user 
- post pictures, url link, samples (ie for music) of the things you want to sell 
- if you are a permanent user you do not need to pay a fee when you are trying to sell products 
- if you are a guest user you must pay a fee of Y Wolverine coin that is non refundable 
- if your product doesn't sell within two weeks then it will automatically be taken off the auction website 
- if your product should be sold, 15% of your profit will automatically be deducted and given to the website. This amount is fixed for both guest and permanent users 


How to buy things:
- this website will only accept Wolverine coin 
- there is no difference for a guest user and a permanent user in the price of the product being sold (for example, a 20 wolverine coin NFT would be 20 wolv coins for a guest and permanent user)
- HOWEVER if you are a permanent user, every time you buy something you get gems. if you collect enough gems you can then get into some kind of private game, etc. 
- once a user bids on a product, the time is extended for the product like Opensea
- you can see the people who are placing bets on items --> like their username 


General Design + Mechanics: 
- there is a chat feature where all users can interact 
- once a item is bought a message to all interested users is sent telling them that the item was bought by X user 
- bought item will go to the buyers metamask wallet 
- bought item will be removed from auction platform
